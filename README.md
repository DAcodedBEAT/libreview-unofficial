# LibreView Unofficial API Documentation

This is community-driven, unofficial documentation for the LibreView API. It is not affiliated with Abbott Diabetes Care, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (see disclaimer below).

The LibreView API is used by Abbott's [LibreLinkUp](https://www.librelinkup.com/) app. This documentation aims to allow community initiatives like [LoopKit](https://github.com/loopkit) and [GlucoseDirect](https://github.com/creepymonster/GlucoseDirect) to use the same data for analysis and automated insuline delivery, in spirit of [#WeAreNotWaiting](https://healthnews.com/health-conditions/diabetes/what-is-the-wearenotwaiting-diabetes-diy-movement/).

## Usage

You can browse the API documentation at [https://libreview-unofficial.stoplight.io/](https://libreview-unofficial.stoplight.io/). From here, you can try the API requests directly, against the Stoplight mock server, or [`libreview-proxy`](https://github.com/FokkeZB/libreview-proxy) deployed at [https://libreview-proxy.onrender.com/](https://libreview-proxy.onrender.com/) (to avoid CORS issues).

You can also use the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/FokkeZB/libreview-unofficial/blob/master/reference/LibreView.yaml) directly, for example to [generate clients](https://openapi-generator.tech/).
